# Simple-login-system-using-face-recognition

this code will capture your image through webcam. if you enter 1 as input, it is signup. it will store your captured image in an dictionary with autogenerated id as key to identify your image uniquely.

and if you enter 2 as input, it captures image and compare your image with each and every image in dictionary, if image is found prints successfully logged in else prints login fails.

drawback: need to insert images into dictionary everytime before using code.
the drawback can be overcomed using an database.
